This repo demonstrates how [ProseMirror] could be used to build a visual editor for [Govspeak].

Govspeak is a flavour of Markdown used for publishing content on [GOV.UK].

## Editor overview

The editor implements a schema based on the [prosemirror-schema-basic] and [prosemirror-schema-list] modules, extended with some Govspeak-specific nodes (such as [callouts]).

It also builds upon the [prosemirror-example-setup] package which provides a basic editor UI and some useful configuration defaults.

### Govspeak-specific nodes

You'll find custom Govspeak-specific nodes defined in the [src/nodes](src/nodes) directory.

Each 'node' file in that directory defines a few things:

1. A [NodeSpec], which describes the node's schema for use with the [prosemirror-model] module
2. Input rules, which enable users to type Markdown-esque syntax to create nodes using the [prosemirror-inputrules] module
3. A `buildMenu` function which can add custom buttons to the toolbar menu provided by the [prosemirror-example-setup] module.
